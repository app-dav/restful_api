# restful_api
1. Run in Visual Studio using "Run as Administrator" mode
(NOTE:This is due to the decision to use a file based DB for persistence. 
      In anything other than a coding exercise, this could easily be handled 
      via a post deployment script adding the permissions for the iis app user account to the folder.
      But I've never used this file db and i wanted to play with it, so I went with it.)

2. F5 Run
3. (NOTE: If running in iis, the urls will be the same as required, but with the addition of port 55887.
    I'm assuming you know that, but still...)
